This project is the first one in The Odin Project Foundation series. 
It is a basic HTML based webpage for recipes.

[Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

In this lesson I will use what I have learned about basic HTML including headers, links, images, lists, emphasis, paragraphs etc.
