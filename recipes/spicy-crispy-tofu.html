        <h2>This is a super simple recipe for my go to spicy tofu!</h2>
            <p>This recipe is very easy to make and doesn't take a lot of time, effort, or thinking. 
            I make it all the time as part of a simple dinner with rice and any sort of steamed, sauteed, or baked veggie. The actual work for it only takes a few minutes and 
            it is ready to plate or throw in a bowl after about 30 minutes — as long as you preheat the oven while getting the tofu ready.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra Firm Tofu (the firmer the better!) — Fontaine Sante is great if you can find it.</li>
                <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Sriracha Spice Mix</li>
                <li>Ground Ginger</li>
                <li>Paprika</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
                <li>Start preheating your oven to 450 fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Measure one tablespoon of olive oil into a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Add half a teaspoon of salt.</li>
                <li>Add two teaspoons of Sriracha spice.</li>
                <li>Add two teaspoons of ground ginger.</li>
                <li>Add two teaspoons of paprika.</li>
                <li>Mix the oil and spices using a spoon.</li>
                <li>Open the tofu and rinse under cold water.</li>
                <li>On a clean cutting board chop the tofu into small cubes.</li>
                <li>Add the tofu to the oil and spice mix and stir until well coated.</li>
                <li>Put a sheet of parchment paper down on a baking tray and dump the tofu onto it.</li>
                <li>Put the baking tray into the oven and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>When done, take the tofu out and serve with rice and veggies. (I like to steam both in a rice cooker so it finishes around the same time as the tofu.)</li>
            </ol>
