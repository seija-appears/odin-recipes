        <h2>Salty, garlicy, and oh so delicious, these savoury red beans are sure to delight.</h2>
        <p>These take some pre-planning as they should be soaked over night, but they are worth the wait. Adding aromatics and salt to your water takes beans to a whole 
            new level. You'll never want to eat canned beans again!
        </p>
        <p>The same basic recipe can be used for any dried bean, and if you're using something like a thin skinned black bean or a white eyed bean you can get away
            with a shorter soak.
