                <p>These take some pre-planning as they should be soaked over night, but they are worth the wait. Adding aromatics and salt to your water takes beans to a whole 
                new level. You'll never want to eat canned beans again!
                </p>
                <p>The same basic recipe can be used for any dried bean, and if you're using something like a thin skinned black bean or a white eyed bean you can get away
                with a shorter soak. I like my beans pretty mushy, like the ancient Romans, so you may need to adjust your cooking times to suit your palette. 
                They can be used as they are out of the pot, or they can be mashed with the carrot and garlic. I primarily use them mixed with rice and steamed veggies or as a taco filling.

                <h4>Soaking the Beans</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Measure two cups of red beans into a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Sort through the beans, removing any non beans, shrivelled beans, broken beans, or ones that just have a bad vibe.</li>
                    <li>Fill the bowl with cold water, covering the beans by a few inches.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl and place out of the way.</li>
                    <li>Let the beans soak for about eight hours, if soaking for longer they should be placed in the fridge.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Cooking the Beans</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the beans and water out through a strainer and remove any beans that have split while soaking.</li>
                    <li>Add the beans to your Instant Pot.</li>
                    <li>Cover the beans with a few inches of cold water.</li>
                    <li>Salt the water, it should be pleasantly salty to your taste.</li>
                    <li>Peel the garlic cloves and put them in the pot.</li>
                    <li>Scrub the carrot and chop it into large chunks.</li>
                    <li>Toss them into the pot.</li>
                    <li>Close the instant pot lid, make sure the valve is set to sealing, and plug it in.</li>
                    <li>Set the pot to pressure cook, high pressure, 30 minutes, keep warm off. You may need to adjust the cook time depending on your pressure cooker, taste and the age of your beans.</li>
                    <li>Once the cooking cycle has completed let the instant pot do a natural release.</li>
                    <li>Strain the beans once again.</li>
                    <li>Remove the bay leaf. Removing the carrots and garlic is optional but I prefer to leave them in.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the beans into a bowl and refrigerate any unused portions.</li>
                </ol>
