        <h2>Salty and Delicious, these golden fries have a spicy kick</h2>
        <p>I'm a big fan of curry, and a big fan of french fries. With a new air fryer I've been trying a lot of new things.
            These simple fries are easy to make and deliciously addictive.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Russet Potatoes, as many as you can reasonably steam and then fit in your air fryer without crowding. I find 3-5 tends to work well.</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Curry Spice</li>
            <li>Ground Ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scrub the potatoes under cold water.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes lengthwise, about 1cm thick.</li>
            <li>Steam the potatoes for about 20-30 minutes, depending on what you're using. I use a rice cooker and steamer basket for 30.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes steam we'll prepare the oil. Pour 1-2 tablespoons into a 2 liter bowl.</li>
            <li>Add salt, curry powder, and ginger powder to taste.</li>
            <li>Mix them all together well.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are done take them out of the steamer and let them dry off a bit/pat them dry gently with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Put the potatoes into the oil and stir them gently so they all get covered. Don't worry if you break some, those will turn into delicious bits.</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes in an air fryer for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>Shake the potatoes about 2/3 of the way through or when your air fryer beeps at you for attention.</li>
        </ol>
